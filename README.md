# TikTok Trending Bot
### View the live page [here](https://twitter.com/AllBotTrending)
I built this bot using python, and am hosting it on Heroku <br>
It calls an API to scrape Tik Tok and return the data for trending videos. <br>
It then formats that data and sends it to the Twitter API to post. <br>

#### Future
I would love to create my own script to scrape Tik Tok and return trending data, instead of relying on someone else.
